#UX
##User stories

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a Hiker, i would like to organize the route i will take to ensure i get the most of my trip.

As a family member to the hiker, i would like to know their route in advance to keep track of their journey.

As a potential hiker, i would like to see my potential stops along the trail and determine if its something im capable of.

as a park ranger, i'd like to be able to see the sites my potential visitors will go to so i can more efficiently keep track of the most trafficed places.

as an employer, id like to review Datum's work and have a method that leads to his social media for contacting purposes.

##Design Notes: 

i wanted something simple and clean that showed some nature, the wireframes i used can be found below. 

###Features

The project implements the Google Maps API with an external waypoint list.



 
### Existing Features
- Each marker has an "add" button to append it to the list element and a "remove" button to clear it off of the list.
 For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.



### Features Left to Implement
- I was working with a local storage version but couldnt get a working version going in time but it will be added in the future.

- An option to email the list to the user after they've created it along with lat and lng point for users with outdoors GPS units

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
