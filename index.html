			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Various Eastern Woodlands Indian groups, including the Pennacook, Mohican (Mahican), and
						Susquehanna, inhabited the northern half of the Appalachians for centuries before European
						settlement.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In the southern mountains, the Cherokee were predominant. Warfare and eviction had driven most of
						the Indian populations from the mountains by the mid-19th century. The so-called Trail of Tears,
						the forced march of the Cherokee to Oklahoma in the fall and winter of 1838–39, is perhaps the
						best-known episode of Indian removal.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> The pinnacle of the Appalachians, Mount Mitchell, once called Black Dome because of its blanket
						of virgin evergreens, is now a ghost forest of dead trees.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Southern Appalachian highlanders developed a distinctive culture characterized by handicrafts,
						ballads, folklore, and mores that reflect both the massive problems and the rich potential of
						the region.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Despite the early arrival of the lumber industry and the opening of the coal mines, some areas of
						Appalachia remained isolated until early in the 20th century, notably those mountain areas of
						the southern region where rough terrain hindered road building.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The diversity that characterizes Appalachian plant and animal life also exists in the system’s
						mineral resources. As the immense stands of timber throughout the Appalachians brought into
						existence important lumber and wood-pulp industries, so rich coal beds, veins of iron ore, salt
						springs and licks, and deposits of granite and marble created major American industries in the
						region. </p>

						(sugar maple, buckeye, beech, ash, birch, and red and white oak). Farther south are hickory,
						poplar, walnut, sycamore, and at one time the important and—before they were destroyed by
						blight—plentiful chestnuts. All of these, plus other of the 140 species of trees of Appalachia,
						are found in the southern mountain region.</p>

					<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_black_bear">The American black bear (Ursus
							americanus, previously known as Euarctos americanus)</a> is a medium-sized bear native to
						North America. It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. American
						black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location.
						They typically live in largely forested areas, but do leave forests in search of food. Sometimes
						they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food. The
						American black bear is the world's most common bear species. It is listed by the International
						Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a least-concern species, due to its widespread
						distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species
						combined. Along with the brown bear, it is one of only two of the eight modern bear species not
						considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction. It is important to excercise
						an abundance of caution when in the presence of wildlife, its best to observe the black bear
						from a distance.</p>
